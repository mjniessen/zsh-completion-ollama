# zsh-completion for ollama (cli tool)

I haven't found any completion for ollama (CLI binary), so I just wrote my own. 
It's still work in progress, but it makes my work with ollama easier already. 

### Helper functions
_ollama_internet_models: This function fetches a list of internet models from the Ollama API.
_ollama_internet_model_versions: This function fetches the version history for an individual model from the Ollama API.
