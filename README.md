# zsh-completions

My additional completion files for ZSH to almost complete collections like
[zsh-users/zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/)

## _ans

Very simple completion for just the two of us using this silly 'tool'.

## _ollama

I haven't found any completion for ollama (CLI binary), so I just wrote my own. 
It's still work in progress, but it makes my work with ollama easier already. 

### Helper functions
_ollama_internet_models: This function fetches a list of internet models from the Ollama API.
_ollama_internet_model_versions: This function fetches the version history for an individual model from the Ollama API.

## _pick

Very simple completion for just the two of us using this silly 'tool'.

## _radio

Completion that fetches list of supported stations by its own.

## _wrap

Very simple completion for just the two of us using this silly 'tool'.
